  <h1>BigInt.fromString ( _string_, _radix_ )</h1>
  <p>The `BigInt.fromString` function produces an integer value dictated by interpretation of the contents of the _string_ argument according to the specified _radix_. Leading white space in _string_ is ignored. If _radix_ is *undefined* or 0, it is assumed to be 10.</p>
  <p>When the `BigInt.fromString` function is called, the following steps are taken:</p>
  <emu-alg>
    1. Let _inputString_ be ? ToString(_string_).
    1. Let _S_ be a newly created substring of _inputString_ consisting of the first code unit that is not a |StrWhiteSpaceChar| and all code units following that code unit. (In other words, remove leading white space.) If _inputString_ does not contain any such code unit, let _S_ be the empty string.
    1. Let _sign_ be 1.
    1. If _S_ is not empty and the first code unit of _S_ is the code unit 0x002D (HYPHEN-MINUS), let _sign_ be -1.
    1. If _S_ is not empty and the first code unit of _S_ is the code unit 0x002B (PLUS SIGN) or the code unit 0x002D (HYPHEN-MINUS), remove the first code unit from _S_.
    1. Let _R_ be ? ToInt32(_radix_).
    1. If _R_ = 0, then
      1. Let _R_ be 10.
    1. Else,
      1. Assert: _R_ &ne; 0.
      1. If _R_ &lt; 2 or _R_ &gt; 36, throw a *RangeError* exception.
    1. If _S_ contains a code unit that is not a radix-_R_ digit, then
      1. Let _Z_ be the substring of _S_ consisting of all code units before the first such code unit.
    1. Else,
      1. Let _Z_ be _S_.
    1. If _Z_ is empty, throw a *SyntaxError* exception.
    1. Let _mathInt_ be the mathematical integer value that is represented by _Z_ in radix-_R_ notation, using the letters <b>A</b>-<b>Z</b> and <b>a</b>-<b>z</b> for digits with values 10 through 35.
    1. Let _number_ be _sign_ &times; _mathInt_.
    1. Return the BigInt value for _number_.
  </emu-alg>
  <emu-note>
    <p>`BigInt.fromString` may interpret only a leading portion of _string_ as an integer value; it ignores any code units that cannot be interpreted as part of the notation of an integer, and no indication is given that any such code units were ignored.</p>

    1. Return the Number value for _number_.
